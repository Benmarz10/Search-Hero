# SearchHero!

## Description
With this website we make it easier to traverse the mcu(marvel cinematic universe) and learn more about its heroes and characters.We would search through the comic book descriptions and list them in our page instead of just using the marvel cinematic bios they had. The works that each hero was used in could be found through the comics in our marvel api to even the movies or tv shows and info found in the wiki api.There are over 8000 characters in the mcu and with more stories to be told we thought it would be great to have a website to help fans and users get to know more of the characters and their unique stories. 

We learned how to use a new css framework called Bulma. We also learned how to use the marvel api(very tricky) and the wiki api.We had to get a hash/time stamp generated and used 2 api keys for the marvel. 

Our project has a unique website that will give the user a simple platform to go through and learn about their heroes all in one easy location instead of traversing through a lot of websites on google.
